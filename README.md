## What is this?

It will probably, eventually be a game.

The plan is to make a server for a multiplayer factory building game, with a terminal based client.

### server

Start the server with ```npm start``` from the server folder.

The default port is 2567, but can be changed in the server's settings.json.

### client

Run the client with ```npm run now``` from the client folder.
